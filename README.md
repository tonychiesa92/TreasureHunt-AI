# TreasureHunt-AI

### Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

In this project I completed the code for the Q-Training Algorithm section in the Jupyter Notebook. 

The code I wrote completes the program for the intelligent agent so that it achieves its goal, I applid a deep Q-learning algorithm to solve a pathfinding problem, and I use industry-standard best practices such as in-line comments to enhance readability and maintainability.


### Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
- What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
- How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
- What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

Computer scientists assist in providing users to access huge amounts of data that can be accessible. This is significant because it provides individuals with platform to create unique user experiences and interfaces for manipulating and accessing data. My approach to problem solving as a computer scientist is focusing on and managing the methodologies, techniques, and tools that help during each phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).The way I address ethical concerns is during each stage of a development lifecycle is by being able to answer questions like is there consent to use data from users, are there safety and transparency measures in place, and are we doing everything we can to have algorithmic fairness, and is data privacy being taken into account?
