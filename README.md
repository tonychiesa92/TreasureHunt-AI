# TreasureHunt-AI

### Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

In this project I completed the code for the Q-Training Algorithm section in the Jupyter Notebook. 

The code I wrote completes the program for the intelligent agent so that it achieves its goal, I applid a deep Q-learning algorithm to solve a pathfinding problem, and I use industry-standard best practices such as in-line comments to enhance readability and maintainability.


### Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
- What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
- How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
- What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
